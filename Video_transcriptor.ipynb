            "Summary: The world you see is not real. You're not living in this very moment that you're experiencing. It turns out your brain constructs your reality. It edits your memories as they happen. It lives in totally different timesfares and tells you a story about the world that feels real. Each day for around two hours you're completely blind. Your brain fills this time with its best guesses of what happened during the blackness. If you could actually see what your eyes see, it would look something like this. What you feel is now is in fact a selectively edited version of the past. You really only consciously experience the world 0.3 to 0.5 seconds after things happened. If your brain showed you the past whether ball was 100 milliseconds ago it would hit you before you could react. So instead your brain takes its location, speed and direction and calculates where the ball should be in the future. By the time the information reaches you and then it creates a fictional version of it. Your conscious experience is nothing more than an invented future. By the time you consciously see the ball coming at you and decide to hit it in a particular way your body has already hit it back. This is not just true for extreme sports like come, table tennis, but also for walking. Walking is time travel. Your brain is operating in three different timesfares at once. It processes the sensory feedback of the past. It calculates the current state of your body and it predicts your future. Within 200 milliseconds pre-programmed sequences activate to catch your fall. 100 milliseconds later when you become aware that you're tripping your body is already recovering. You are only just now catching up. Your sense of hunger, your energy level and especially your emotions are not just objective reactions to what state you're in but predictions. Your brain's prediction of what you'll need soon or need to be ready for. A self fulfilling prophecy. If your brain predicts anxiousness it adjusts your heart rate, hormone levels and muscle tensions before you even enter the room. It prepares your body for anxiety, making you actually feel anxious, which then confirms the brain's prediction. What your conscious self is good at is long-term planning and abstract thinking. It's a storyteller that tells the story of your life to your brain and to yourself. You are able to see the big picture that your internal prediction machine could never begin to grasp. Brilliant helps you get smarter every day, with thousands of bite-sized interactive lessons. Explore the big ideas powering technology like AI or learn the fundamentals of programming. delve into the physics behind everything from a game of pool to black holes. Learn how language models like chat GBT choose their next words. Their latest course on generative AI will help boost your human intelligence. Whatever you choose to learn on Brilliant, it only takes a few minutes each day to change your reality. Wishlisting is incredibly important for indie games like Hours. It helps us get noticed, reach more players and keeps you updated as we develop the game. If you want to be part of this adventure, please wishlist to starbirds on steam using the link in the description.\n"
